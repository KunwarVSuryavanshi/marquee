# Note

1. Styling and structure for the add todo could be improved further and changed, since my main focus was on the functionality for now.

2. CredentialsContext is storing mock data for the login. (This local functionality can be changed with the supabase/firebase/MSAL cloud service for authentication)

3. AuthContext is for storing user login data after he logs in.

4. TodoContext is for storing the todo data.

5. Application instance can be found <a href="https://marquee-one.vercel.app/login">here</a>
